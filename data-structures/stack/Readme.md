# Stack

A stack is a conceptional structure consisting of a set of homogeneous elements and is based on the principle of last
in first out (LIFO). It is a commonly used abstract data type with two major operations, namely push and pop. Push and pop
are carried out on the topmost element, which is the item most recently added to the stack. The push operation adds an 
element to the stack while the pop operation removes an element from the top position. The stack concept is used in 
programming and memory organization in computers.



## Methods

- [ ] `push()`: Add element to the stack.
- [ ] `pop()`: Remove element and return it.
- [ ] `peek()`: Get the top data element of the stack.
- [ ] `isEmpty()`: Check if stack is empty.


## Complexity

#### Time Complexity

| Methods      | Complexity |  
| :----------: | :----------------: |  
| `push()`     |      O(1)          |  
| `pop()`      |      O(1)          |  
| `peek()`     |      O(1)          |
