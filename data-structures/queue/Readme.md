# Queue

A queue is a conceptional structure consisting of a set of homogeneous elements and is based on the principle of first
in first out (FIFO). It is a commonly used abstract data type with two major operations, namely enQueue and deQueue. enQueue and deQueue
are carried out on the bottommost element, which is the item  added firstly to the queue. The enQueue operation adds an 
element to the queue while the pop operation removes an element from the bottom position. The queue concept is used in 
programming and memory organization in computers.



## Methods

- [x] `enQueue()`: Add element to the bottom of the queue.
- [x] `deQueue()`: Remove bottommost element and return it.
- [x] `peek()`: Get the bottommost element of the stack.
- [x] `isEmpty()`: Check if queue is empty.


## Complexity

#### Time Complexity

| Methods      | Complexity |  
| :----------: | :----------------: |  
| `enQueue()`  |      O(1)          |  
| `deQueue()`  |      O(1)          |
