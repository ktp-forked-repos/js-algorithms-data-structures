Collection of most used data structures, design patterns, and algorithms written in TypeScript. Each algorithm has 
a separate Readme file with an explanation of the algorithm, well-commented source code, test cases implemented in Jest, 
and online demo for playing around.

## üóÉ Data Structures

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient 
access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, 
and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

#### Basic Data Structures                              

- `B` [Linked List](data-structures/linked-list): with/without tail pointer      
- `B` [Stack](data-structures/stack)                                            
- `B` [Queue](data-structures/queue)                                                  
- `B` [Hash Table](data-structures/hash-table)             

#### Tree                                               
- `B` [Heap](data-structures/heap): min/max version                                                                 
- `B` Priority Queue

## üõ† Algorithms 

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely 
define a sequence of operations.

## üé® Design Patterns

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software
design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or 
template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
